  "supportFrequentlyQuestionSpan": "Frequently asked questions",
  "support": "Support",
  "supportInfoTitle1": "Do you store my private keys?",
  "supportInfoContent1": "No! Komodo Classic Wallet is non-custodial. We never store any sensitive data, private keys, seed phrases, or your PIN. This data is only stored locally, and is encrypted with your wallet password. It never leaves your device unless you export it. You are in full control of your assets.",
  "supportInfoTitle2": "How is trading with Komodo Wallet different from trading on other DEXs?",
  "supportInfoContent2": "Most DEXs only allow you to trade assets that are based on a single blockchain network, use proxy tokens, and only allow placing a single order with the same funds. Komodo Wallet enables you to trade across different blockchain networks without proxy tokens, and use the same funds to place multiple orders for different pairs. For example, you can sell 0.1 BTC for KMD, QTUM, or VRSC — the first order that fills automatically cancels all other orders.",
  "supportInfoTitle3": "How long does each atomic swap take?",
  "supportInfoContent3": "Several factors determine the processing time for each swap. The block time of the traded assets depends on each network (i.e. a BTC swap with 10 minute block time will typically be slower than a KMD swap with 1 minute block time). Depending on your security preferences, you can increase or lower the number of confirmations required, which will also affect the speed of your swap. For example, you can configure Komodo Wallet to consider a KMD transaction as final after just 3 confirmations which makes the swap time faster compared to waiting for a notarization.",
  "supportInfoTitle4": "Do I need to be online for the duration of the swap?",
  "supportInfoContent4": "Yes. You must remain connected to the internet and have your app running to successfully complete each atomic swap (very short breaks in connectivity are usually fine). If you go offline, there is risk of trade cancellation if you are a maker, or risk of loss of fees if you are a taker (remaining funds will be refunded after a few hours). The atomic swap protocol requires both participants to stay online so that Komodo Wallet can monitor the involved blockchains for the process to stay atomic. If you go offline, so will your orders, and any swaps that are in progress will fail, leading to potential loss of trade / transaction fees, and a wait time for the swap HTLC to timeout and issue a refund. It may also negatively affect your wallet's reputation score for future trade matching. When you come back online, your orders will begin to broadcast again at the price you set before you went offline. If there has been significant price movement in the meantime, you might unintentionally offer someone a bargain! For this reason, we recommend cancelling orders before closing Komodo Wallet, or reviewing and revising your prices when restarting Komodo Wallet.",
  "supportInfoTitle5": "How are the fees in Komodo Wallet calculated?",
  "supportInfoContent5": "There are two fee categories to consider when trading with Komodo Wallet. Komodo Wallet charges approximately 0.13% (1/777 of trading volume but not lower than 0.0001) as the trading fee for taker orders, and maker orders have zero trade fee! Both makers and takers will need to pay normal network transaction fees to the involved blockchains when making atomic swap transactions. Network transaction fees can vary greatly depending on your selected trading pair, and will include gas fees paid in the parent coin where applicable (e.g. a BTC-BEP20 to BTC-ERC20 trade will require BNB and ETH to pay the gas fee).",
  "supportInfoTitle6": "Do you provide user support?",
  "supportInfoContent6": "Yes! Komodo Wallet offers support through the <a href='https://komodoplatform.com/discord'>Komodo Discord server</a>. The team and the community are always happy to help!",
  "supportInfoTitle7": "Who is behind Komodo Wallet?",
  "supportInfoContent7": "Komodo Wallet is developed by the Komodo team. Komodo is one of the most established blockchain projects working on innovative solutions like atomic swaps, Delayed Proof of Work, and an interoperable multi-chain architecture.",
  "supportInfoTitle8": "Is it possible to develop my own white-label exchange on Komodo Wallet?",
  "supportInfoContent8": "Absolutely! You can read our developer documentation at <a href='https://developers.komodoplatform.com'>https://developers.komodoplatform.com</a> for more details or contact us with your partnership inquiries. Have a specific technical question? The Komodo Wallet developer community is always ready to help!",
  "supportInfoTitle9": "Which devices can I use Komodo Wallet on?",
  "supportInfoContent9": "Komodo Wallet is available for mobile on both <a href='https://atomicdex.io/'>Android and iPhone, and for desktop on Windows, Mac, and Linux</a> operating systems.",
  "supportInfoTitle10": "Compliance Info",
  "supportInfoContent10": "Due to regulatory and legal restrictions the citizens of certain jurisdictions including, but not limited to, the United States of America, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, Sudan, Austria, Iran (and any other state, country or other jurisdiction that is embargoed by the United States of America or the European Union) are not allowed to use this application.",
